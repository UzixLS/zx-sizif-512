### Magic button
Sizif has a number of configurable parameters that you can change on the fly. To do this just hold Magic button for a second.

[![photo](doc/sizif-menu.gif)](doc/sizif-menu.gif?raw=true)

To navigate menu you can use up-down keys, to change value use enter or left-right keys. Kempston, Sinclair, Cursor and QAOP supported.

If you press Magic button for a short time, the standard NMI handler 'll be called.

### Sega gamepad buttons
Sega gamepad support will be available starting from PCB rev.D (or Rev.C with slight modifications).
| Button | Function in Kempston mode | Function in Sinclair mode |
| - | - | - |
| Up | Up | 9 |
| Down | Down | 8 |
| Left | Left | 6 |
| Right | Right | 7 |
| A | Button 3 | N |
| B | Button 1 | 0 |
| C | Button 2 | M |
| X | Turbo Button 3 | Turbo N |
| Y | Turbo Button 1 | Turbo 0 |
| Z | Turbo Button 2 | Turbo M |
| Start | Pause | Pause |
| Mode | Magic button | Magic button |

### PS/2 keyboard buttons
| Button | Function |
| - | - |
| F5 | Magic button |
| F12 | Pause |
| Ctrl+Alt+Del | Reboot |
| Ctrl+Alt+Backspace | Reboot |
| Numpad 8, 2/5, 4, 6 | Joystick's up-down-left-right |
| Numpad 0/Enter | Joystick's fire |
| Alt | Joystick's fire |

### RAM
Sizif contains 512K RAM. There are two cases how to access it:
1. DivMMC enabled (SD card insert) - 128K available via 7FFDh port, 128K via DFFDh (Profi standart, most compatible with old 128K software) and 128K reserved for DivMMC.
2. No SD card present - 128K available via 7FFDh and 384K via DFFDh. Please note: ULAplus and Magic button shares one page of memory with DFFD port. If you run 512K-software, it's good idea not to use ULAplus and Magic.

Note that DFFDh port available only in Pentagon mode.

### SD card
Sizif have preinstalled esxDOS firmware, which provides ability to load TAP, TRD, SCL, Z80 files and save snapshots. To use this you should format SD cart to FAT32 or FAT16 and unpack latest esxDOS release ([link](http://www.esxdos.org/index.html)) to card. Also it's recommended to install Long Filename Browser ([link](https://spectrumcomputing.co.uk/forums/viewtopic.php?t=2553)) to card.
