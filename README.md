 ## Sizif-512

Another CPLD-based ZX Spectrum clone for 48K rubber case with additional features.  
**Please note: work in progress, not all things implemented at the moment**

### Features
* Half-sized PCB for 48K rubber case, no case modifications necessary
* Pentagon 128 and Spectrum 128 timings
* Real Z80 in 3.5MHz and 7MHz (no-wait turbo) mode
* 512K RAM
* Kempston Joystick
* Integrated Beta Disk Interface
* Integrated DivMMC
* PAL and RGB video out (Sega Mini-DIN/9 connector)
* Digital video out (EGA header ;))
* Switchable stereo ABC/ACB
* Mono covox

### Magic button
Sizif have some configurable things which you may change at any moment and that's doesn't require reboot.
To do this there is a Magic button: just hold it and press key on keyboard:
| Key | Function |
| - | - |
| 1 | Switch to Pentagon 128 timings (by default) |
| 2 | Switch to Spectrum 128 timings |
| 3 | Switch to 3.5 MHz (normal) mode (by default) |
| 4 | Switch to 7 MHz (turbo) mode |
| 5 | Switch to ABC stereo (by default) |
| 6 | Switch to ACB stereo |
| 9 | Enable all additional features: DivMMC, 512K RAM, Kempston, Covox (by default) |
| 0 | Disable all additional features |

If you press Magic button and didn't change something, standard NMI handler 'll be called on button release.

### RAM
The board contains 512K RAM. There are two cases how to access it:
1. DivMMC enabled (SD card insert) - 128K available via 7FFDh port, 128K via DFFDh and 256K reserved for DivMMC.
2. No SD card present - 128K available via 7FFDh and 384K via DFFDh

### DivMMC and BDI coexistence
DivMMC can't be property used with BDI by it's design. So when SD card insert, BDI goes into inactive state.

### Strange lines on border and creaky sounds on SD card access
It's not a bug, it's a feature ;)

### WiFi module
It's possible to connect to internet with additional [WiFi module](https://github.com/UzixLS/zx-sizif-512-wifi).

### Changelog & current status
* Rev.A - first release. Done. Please see [errata](pcb/rev.A/ERRATA.ru.txt) (in russian)
* Rev.B - abandoned. Files keep for historical reason.
* Rev.C - BDI has been removed; better video circuit; more capable CPLD. Work in progress.
* Rev.C1 - fixed incorrect JTAG pinout; fixed incorrect silkscreen for power connector J3. Everything seems to work.

This work is based on a lot of other projects and would hardly have been successful without them.
